# --- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---

A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a <em><b>passphrase</b></em> instead of simply a pass<em><b>word</b></em>. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.


To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.


For example:


<ul>
<li><code>aa bb cc dd ee</code> is valid.</li>
<li><code>aa bb cc dd aa</code> is not valid - the word <code>aa</code> appears more than once.</li>
<li><code>aa bb cc dd aaa</code> is valid - <code>aa</code> and <code>aaa</code> count as different words.</li>
</ul>
The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. <em><b>How many passphrases are valid?</b></em>
