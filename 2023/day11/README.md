# --- Day 11: Cosmic Expansion ---

You continue following signs for "Hot Springs" and eventually come across an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory](observatory). The Elf within turns out to be a researcher studying cosmic expansion using the giant telescope here.


He doesn't know anything about the missing machine parts; he's only visiting for this research project. However, he confirms that the hot springs are the next-closest area likely to have people; he'll even take you straight there once he's done with today's observation analysis.


Maybe you can help him with the analysis to speed things up?


The researcher has collected a bunch of data and compiled the data into a single giant <em><b>image</b></em> (your puzzle input). The image includes <em><b>empty space</b></em> (<code>.</code>) and <em><b>galaxies</b></em> (<code>#</code>). For example:


<pre><code>...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.........#
..........
.......#..
#...#.....
</code></pre>
The researcher is trying to figure out the sum of the lengths of the <em><b>shortest path between every pair of galaxies</b></em>. However, there's a catch: the universe expanded in the time it took the light from those galaxies to reach the observatory.


Due to something involving gravitational effects, <em><b>only some space expands</b></em>. In fact, the result is that <em><b>any rows or columns that contain no galaxies</b></em> should all actually be twice as big.


In the above example, three columns and two rows contain no galaxies:


<pre><code>   v  v  v
 ...#......
 .......#..
 #.........
&gt;..........&lt;
 ......#...
 .#........
 .........#
&gt;..........&lt;
 .......#..
 #...#.....
   ^  ^  ^
</code></pre>
These rows and columns need to be <em><b>twice as big</b></em>; the result of cosmic expansion therefore looks like this:


<pre><code>....#........
.........#...
#............
.............
.............
........#....
.#...........
............#
.............
.............
.........#...
#....#.......
</code></pre>
Equipped with this expanded universe, the shortest path between every pair of galaxies can be found. It can help to assign every galaxy a unique number:


<pre><code>....1........
.........2...
3............
.............
.............
........4....
.5...........
............6
.............
.............
.........7...
8....9.......
</code></pre>
In these 9 galaxies, there are <em><b>36 pairs</b></em>. Only count each pair once; order within the pair doesn't matter. For each pair, find any shortest path between the two galaxies using only steps that move up, down, left, or right exactly one <code>.</code> or <code>#</code> at a time. (The shortest path between two galaxies is allowed to pass through another galaxy.)


For example, here is one of the shortest paths between galaxies <code>5</code> and <code>9</code>:


<pre><code>....1........
.........2...
3............
.............
.............
........4....
.5...........
.##.........6
..##.........
...##........
....##...7...
8....9.......
</code></pre>
This path has length <code><em><b>9</b></em></code> because it takes a minimum of <em><b>nine steps</b></em> to get from galaxy <code>5</code> to galaxy <code>9</code> (the eight locations marked <code>#</code> plus the step onto galaxy <code>9</code> itself). Here are some other example shortest path lengths:


<ul>
<li>Between galaxy <code>1</code> and galaxy <code>7</code>: 15</li>
<li>Between galaxy <code>3</code> and galaxy <code>6</code>: 17</li>
<li>Between galaxy <code>8</code> and galaxy <code>9</code>: 5</li>
</ul>
In this example, after expanding the universe, the sum of the shortest path between all 36 pairs of galaxies is <code><em><b>374</b></em></code>.


Expand the universe, then find the length of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies. <em><b>What is the sum of these lengths?</b></em>
