# --- Day 4: Ceres Search ---

"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the [/2019/day/10](Ceres monitoring station)!


As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her <em><b>word search</b></em> (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: <code>XMAS</code>.


This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of <code>XMAS</code> - you need to find <em><b>all of them</b></em>. Here are a few ways <code>XMAS</code> might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with <code>.</code>:<p>
<pre><code>..X...
.SAMX.
.A..A.
XMAS.S
.X....
</code></pre>
<p>The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:


<pre><code>MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
</code></pre>
In this word search, <code>XMAS</code> occurs a total of <code><em><b>18</b></em></code> times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any <code>XMAS</code> have been replaced with <code>.</code>:


<pre><code>....XXMAS.
.SAMXMS...
...S..A...
..A.A.MS.X
XMASAMX.MM
X.....XA.A
S.S.S.S.SS
.A.A.A.A.A
..M.M.M.MM
.X.X.XMASX
</code></pre>
Take a look at the little Elf's word search. <em><b>How many times does <code>XMAS</code> appear?</b></em>
